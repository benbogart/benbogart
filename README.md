## üë®‚Äçüíª About me

**Director of Data Science & Engineering @ Komaza Forestry**

I love data and I love this planet. My passion is climate change mitigation, and Data Science is my Toolkit.

I am currently working as Director of Data Science & Engineering at [Komaza Forestry](https://komaza.com/) working to uplift farmers out of poverty while capturing as much carbon as possible in the process.
