## üë®‚Äçüíª About me

Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer & Towards Data Science Contributor | Research based data visualization and modeling to save the planet.

Musician by day. Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer by night. Climate Activist always.

In 20 years as a musician and a nonprofit administrator I‚Äôve worn a lot of hats, only one still fits. I‚Äôve run advertising campaigns that landed me on the billboard charts. I started an online music school in 2007 bringing tango music instruction to over 150 students. I‚Äôve toured the world playing music and promoting climate action. I was an award winner in the 2015 Stowe International Bandone√≥n Competition. Those experiences have all taught me that my true passion is data.

For me, everything is about affecting change. As a musicianI leverage my music audience for tangible climate action. I spend my nights using TensorFlow and sklearn to build models to classify bird vocalizations, categorize waste images for recycling, or to determine which advertisements are performing best. I now realize that data is an even more powerful tool for me to affect change than being on stage.

After spending my life building communities of musicians, teachers, volunteers, and students, it's now time for me to join a team that values intentional interaction, productivity, humanity, and science to create tangible change.
